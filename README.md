# Maslow4_Folding_Frame

![](/project.svg)



 Completely parametric x shaped frame. Mostly finished.Still need to add a hole drilling layer.  In real life you would need a chain to connect the outside corners. The hings design was fun to make but unnecessary. If you set the proportions of the tabletop to equal numbers like 8, 8  then it will make a good solid hinge. Good numbers to reset it for real 3/4 in plywood:
